# Wine_classification_and_clustering
Classification and clustering the quality of White Wine using Machine Learning Algorithms. Data Analysis and Visualisation also was conducted.

To run the program use: python main.py. The main just calls the functions defined in the other files, keeps track of the time needed to use the two approaches for nearest-neighbours and print some statistics (false positives, number of duplicates etc). The problem of finding duplicates is tackled into three steps: making of shingles, building a signature matrix and applying LSH to this matrix.
